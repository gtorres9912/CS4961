/*
** Purpose: Define configurations for the OSK C Demo application
**
** Notes:
**   1. These definitions should minimal and only contain parameters that
**      need to be configurable and that must be defined at compile time.  
**      Use app_cfg.h for compile-time parameters that don't need to be
**      configured when an app is deployed and the JSON initialization
**      file for parameters that can be defined at runtime.
